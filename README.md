# LBA Shape Editor

This program can edit shape files from the Little Big Aventure 2 game. 
The shape file is located at index 47 of the Ress.HQR resource file in LBA 2.

Shapes are a kind of vector graphics, which usually indicate character's emotions, and loss of life. For example little stars flying out of Twinsen when he gets hurt.

This program was made quick and it has bugs. It also has very little error checking, so please be careful and don't try to save a file until you have one opened ;)
